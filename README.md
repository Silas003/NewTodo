# DjangoReact
This is a simple react todo webapp that uses django restframework to handle the server side of the webapp using an api
This api was integrated into the webapp using axios and it performs the https verbs:get,put,post and delete

# To run This simple webapp
1.navigate to the backend\fullstack_todo directory
2.run py manage.py runserver to get the server running quickly this is done to prevent errors on the client side
3.copy and paste the url given in the terminal to use the browsable api, 'http://localhost:8080' port
4.go back to the home directory and navigate to frontend/todo directory where the client side was written
5.run npm start to get the client running
6.this would also generate a url 'http://localhost:3000' , the port for react apps where you can see the client or working perfectly
